<div id="integrated-analysis-results" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Integrated Analysis Results</h2>
<p>This report summarizes the results of a multi-agent-AI-system (IAN)
based analysis performed using the provided list of differentially
expressed genes. Results after IAN integrated all the individual agents
responses is provided below:</p>
<div id="high-level-summary" class="section level3">
<h3>1.1. High-Level Summary</h3>
<p>Uveitis pathogenesis involves a complex interplay between
dysregulated immune responses (driven by complement activation and T
cell co-stimulation), impaired ECM remodeling (mediated by <em>FN1</em>
and other ECM proteins), and potentially infectious triggers. Upstream
regulators like NF-κB, IRFs, AP-1, SMAD family members, TFAP2C, and
POU5F1 likely orchestrate these processes. The involvement of
<em>FN1</em> in ECM remodeling and its high network connectivity
suggests a central role in coordinating these processes. The strong
complement activation indicates a significant contribution of innate
immunity. The involvement of CD274 highlights the importance of immune
checkpoint regulation. The presence of Y-chromosome genes suggests a
potential sex-specific component.</p>
</div>
<div id="affected-biological-processes" class="section level3">
<h3>1.2. Affected Biological Processes</h3>
<p>The integrated analysis reveals a highly interconnected network
involving immune dysregulation, complement activation, ECM remodeling,
and potentially neuronal signaling (Agent 3). The overlap in pathway
results across agents strongly supports this conclusion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overlap Genes:</strong> Genes like <em>FN1</em>,
<em>C1QA</em>, <em>C1QB</em>, <em>C1QC</em>, <em>CD274</em>, and
<em>ANK2</em> appear consistently across multiple pathway analyses
(KEGG, WikiPathways, Reactome, GO), highlighting their central roles.
These genes are involved in ECM organization (<em>FN1</em>,
<em>COL4A3</em>, <em>COL4A4</em>), complement activation (<em>C1QA</em>,
<em>C1QB</em>, <em>C1QC</em>, <em>SERPING1</em>), and immune regulation
(<em>CD274</em>, <em>GBP5</em>, <em>GBP1</em>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Unique Genes:</strong> Unique genes in each pathway
analysis suggest specialized roles within the broader context. For
example, Y-chromosome genes (<em>UTY</em>, <em>KDM5D</em>,
<em>USP9Y</em>, <em>DDX3Y</em>, <em>RPS4Y1</em>, <em>EIF1AY</em>) are
enriched, potentially indicating sex-specific aspects of uveitis.
Neuronal-related genes (Agent 3) might suggest a less direct, but still
relevant, connection between the immune response and neurological
processes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="potential-regulatory-networks" class="section level3">
<h3>1.3. Potential Regulatory Networks</h3>
<p>The ChEA analysis (Agent 4) reveals significant enrichment of
transcription factors <em>RELB</em>, <em>SMAD4</em>, <em>TFAP2C</em>,
and <em>POU5F1</em>. These TFs provide a regulatory framework for the
observed gene expression changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>RELB (NF-κB family):</strong> Regulates genes involved in
immune responses (<em>GBP5</em>, <em>CD274</em>), aligning with the
strong complement and interferon signaling pathways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SMAD4 (TGF-β signaling):</strong> Regulates genes
involved in ECM remodeling (<em>FN1</em>, <em>COL4A3</em>,
<em>COL4A4</em>) and cell adhesion, consistent with the observed pathway
enrichments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TFAP2C:</strong> Involved in cell differentiation and
development, potentially influencing the cellular context of the immune
response.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>POU5F1:</strong> Associated with pluripotency, its role
in uveitis requires further investigation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Novel interactions identified by ChEA include TFAP2C’s association
with <em>KCNK17</em> and <em>NOS1AP</em>, and POU5F1’s regulation of
<em>ROR1</em> in an inflammatory context. These warrant further
investigation to determine their novelty and functional significance.*
<strong>NF-κB (via RELB):</strong> Master regulator of inflammation,
driving complement activation and immune responses. * <strong>TGF-β (via
SMAD4):</strong> Influences ECM remodeling and immune regulation,
potentially contributing to fibrosis and tissue damage. *
<strong>TFAP2C:</strong> May modulate cell differentiation and the
cellular context of the immune response. * <strong>POU5F1:</strong> Its
role requires further investigation, but could influence cell fate and
immune cell differentiation. * <strong>IRF family:</strong> Crucial for
interferon responses, driving the expression of genes involved in immune
responses. * <strong>AP-1:</strong> Involved in cell proliferation,
differentiation, and inflammation, potentially regulating genes in Wnt
signaling and ECM remodeling.</p>
</div>
<div id="potential-hub-genes" class="section level3">
<h3>1.4. Potential Hub Genes</h3>
<p>Based on the integrated analysis and STRING network properties,
<em>FN1</em>, <em>C1QA</em>, <em>C1QB</em>, <em>C1QC</em>,
<em>CD274</em>, and <em>ANK2</em> emerge as potential hub genes. These
genes consistently appear across multiple pathways, have high STRING
network scores, and are regulated by key transcription factors
identified in the ChEA analysis. Their central location in the STRING
network and their involvement in multiple key pathways (complement
activation, ECM remodeling, immune regulation) strongly support their
designation as hub genes.</p>
</div>
<div id="similar-systems" class="section level3">
<h3>1.5. Similar Systems</h3>
<p>Other autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis) and inflammatory conditions (inflammatory bowel disease)
share similar pathway enrichments, particularly those related to
complement activation and ECM remodeling. Studies on these diseases
could provide valuable comparative insights.</p>
</div>
<div id="novelty-exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>1.6. Novelty Exploration</h3>
<p>The strong enrichment of pathways related to infectious diseases in
the context of uveitis is potentially novel. While infections can
trigger uveitis, the specific pathways highlighted here may reveal novel
mechanisms linking infection and uveitis pathogenesis. The unexpected
connections between complement activation and infectious disease
pathways are particularly noteworthy. The potential role of POU5F1 in
regulating <em>ROR1</em> in this inflammatory context also warrants
further investigation for novelty.</p>

<p>The provided network, informed by RNA-Seq data from uveitis patients
and healthy controls, centers on a complex interplay of genes and
pathways primarily involved in immune response, complement activation,
cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) highlight the importance of these
processes in the pathogenesis of uveitis. The network reveals
interconnected modules, with key hubs like FN1 (fibronectin), C1QA/C1QB
(complement components), CD274 (PD-L1), and several transcription
factors (e.g., RELB, SMAD4, ATF3) playing central roles. The diverse
etiologies of uveitis within the cohort (axial spondyloarthritis,
sarcoidosis, etc.) likely contribute to variations in the specific DEG
profiles, although the core pathways remain consistent.</p>
</div>
<div id="mechanistic-model" class="section level3">
<h3>2.2. Mechanistic Model</h3>
<p>The identified relationships suggest a mechanistic model where
upstream regulators like RELB and SMAD4, along with ATF3, influence the
uveitis phenotype through their downstream targets. RELB’s regulation of
GBP5 and CD274 suggests a modulation of interferon signaling,
pyroptosis, and T cell activity, potentially contributing to the
inflammatory response. SMAD4’s influence on FN1 suggests a role in
regulating cell adhesion, ECM remodeling, and tissue repair. ATF3 acts
as an integrator, connecting these pathways. The complement system
(C1QA/C1QB) plays a crucial role in initiating and amplifying the
inflammatory response. The interactions between these components suggest
a complex feedback loop that contributes to the sustained inflammation
characteristic of uveitis.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level3">
<h3>2.3. Hypothesis</h3>
<p>We hypothesize that the observed changes in gene expression in
peripheral blood from uveitis patients reflect a systemic dysregulation
of immune responses, complement activation, and cell adhesion processes.
Specifically, we propose that dysregulation of RELB, SMAD4, and ATF3
activity leads to altered expression of their target genes (GBP5, CD274,
FN1, and components of the complement system), resulting in an amplified
inflammatory response, impaired immune regulation, altered ECM
remodeling, and disrupted cell adhesion. This contributes to the
development and progression of uveitis. The specific etiology of uveitis
influences the specific pattern of DEG expression and the relative
contribution of these pathways. Further investigation is needed to
determine the precise causal relationships and the role of other
potential upstream regulators and signaling pathways. The peripheral
blood gene expression profile likely reflects systemic changes, but
further studies are needed to confirm the specific involvement of these
pathways in the ocular inflammation characteristic of uveitis.</p>

<h3>7.3. ChEA LLM Agent Response</h3>
<p>Agent 4: <strong>1. Summary of Enriched Transcription
Factors:</strong></p>
<p>The ChEA analysis identified several transcription factors (TFs)
significantly enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from
the uveitis versus healthy control comparison. RELB, TFAP2C, POU5F1, and
SMAD4 showed the most significant enrichment (p-values &lt; 0.04). These
TFs are known to be involved in immune regulation, cell differentiation,
and development, aligning with the inflammatory nature of uveitis and
the use of whole blood RNA-Seq. The enrichment suggests a complex
interplay of regulatory mechanisms underlying the observed gene
expression changes in uveitis.</p>
<p><strong>2. Regulatory Network Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Several TFs emerge as potential upstream regulators. RELB, an NF-κB
family member, is strongly implicated due to its association with genes
like <em>GBP5</em> and <em>CD274</em>, involved in immune responses.
These genes are enriched in pathways related to interferon signaling
(Reactome, GO), complement activation (Reactome, WikiPathways, GO), and
cell adhesion molecules (KEGG). SMAD4, a key TGF-β signaling component,
also shows significant enrichment, regulating genes involved in focal
adhesion, ECM-receptor interaction, and cytoskeleton organization (KEGG,
WikiPathways, Reactome). The overlap of RELB and SMAD4 target genes in
pathways like ECM-receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules
suggests coordinated regulation. TFAP2C (cell differentiation and
development) and POU5F1 (pluripotency) may play more subtle,
context-setting roles in the immune response.</p>

<h3>8.3. STRING LLM Agent Response</h3>
<p>Agent 6: <strong>1. Summary of Interactions:</strong></p>
<p>The STRING analysis reveals a highly interconnected network of
proteins, predominantly centered around fibronectin (FN1), ankyrin
repeat domain 22 (ANKRD22), and CD274 (PD-L1), all exhibiting high
combined network scores. FN1’s interactions suggest roles in
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and cytoskeletal organization.
ANKRD22 shows extensive connections with immune-related genes,
indicating involvement in immune regulation. CD274’s interactions
highlight the importance of immune checkpoint regulation. These
interactions, particularly the high scores, suggest a complex interplay
between immune response, ECM dynamics, and cell signaling in
uveitis.</p>
<p><strong>2. Key Interactions and Network Topology:</strong></p>
<p>Based on the combined network scores, FN1 (2.734623), ANKRD22
(2.422102), CD274 (2.243023), and FCGR1A (1.791925) emerge as central
nodes. FN1 interacts with numerous proteins, including MYOM2
(cytoskeletal protein), suggesting alterations in cell structure and
potentially impacting immune cell infiltration. ANKRD22 interacts with
several immune-related proteins (e.g., CD274, GBP5, IFI27, APOL4),
suggesting a role in modulating immune responses. CD274, a key immune
checkpoint molecule, interacts with several other immune-related
proteins, indicating a significant role in immune regulation. The
network displays a scale-free topology, with these few hub proteins
connected to many others, and many proteins with fewer connections. This
modular organization suggests distinct functional modules interacting to
contribute to the overall uveitis phenotype. The high combined scores
reflect the strength and significance of these interactions within the
network.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cross-Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>Several connections exist between the high-scoring proteins and the
enriched pathways. FN1, COL4A3, and COL4A4 are present in multiple
pathways related to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and
collagen biosynthesis, aligning with FN1’s role in ECM remodeling. C1QA,
C1QB, and C1QC are central to complement activation pathways, reflecting
the importance of the complement system in uveitis. CD274 and PDCD1LG2
are key players in immune checkpoint pathways, consistent with their
roles in immune regulation.</p>
<p>Several ChEA transcription factors regulate genes involved in these
interactions. RELB regulates GBP5 and CD274, both involved in immune
responses. SMAD4 regulates FN1, ANK2, and ETV7, all involved in ECM
remodeling and immune regulation. TFAP2C regulates several genes
involved in immune regulation and cell signaling. POU5F1 regulates genes
involved in development and differentiation. These transcription factors
could be acting as upstream regulators of the observed interactions.</p>

<h2>11. Analysis Parameters</h2>
<p>The following parameters were used for this analysis:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Experimental Design:&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Ninety subjects with uveitis including axial spondyloarthritis (n = 17), sarcoidosis (n = 13), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 12), tubulointerstitial nephritis with uveitis (n = 10), or idiopathic uveitis (n = 38) as well as 18 healthy controls were enrolled, predominantly at Oregon Health &amp; Science University. RNA-Seq data generated from peripheral, whole blood was used to indentify differentially expressed genes between Uveitis patients and healthy controls.</code></pre>
