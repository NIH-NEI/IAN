Title: IAN : Integrated Enrichment Analysis Using A Multi-Agent AI System
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Vijay Nagarajan [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Vijay Nagarajan <nagarajanv@nih.gov>
Description: IAN is an R package for integrated enrichment analysis, leveraging a multi-agent AI system and Large Language Models. It summarizes and interprets enrichment results from various "Omics" data sources (Seurat, DESeq2, etc.) using pathway databases and protein-protein interaction data. IAN provides insightful interpretations and novel observations in an easy-to-navigate HTML report. It helps researchers explore and decipher complex biological systems by augmenting LLM summarization abilities.
