                  * **SMAD4:**  A key mediator of TGF-Î² signaling, SMAD4's association with FN1 (fibronectin), a crucial component of the extracellular matrix and focal adhesions, highlights its potential role in regulating cell adhesion and tissue remodeling processes relevant to inflammation.\n\n",

Specifically, we hypothesize that dysregulation of RELB and SMAD4 activity leads to altered expression of their target genes (GBP5, CD274, FN1), resulting in an amplified inflammatory response, impaired immune regulation, and altered tissue remodeling, contributing to the development and progression of uveitis.  The specific etiology of uveitis (axial spondyloarthritis, sarcoidosis, etc.) may influence the specific pattern of DEG expression and the relative contribution of these pathways.\n\n",
